Device Maintainer: platinumthis
Device specific changes:

* Tuned LITTEL governor and big one
* Useing now ROW as I/0 scheduler, i tested a lot and in UI and games it woks better, there some governors which dont give the fluid i want for this device, so i decided to use ROW now
* Entropy Read and Write increased too (READ) 448 and 192 (WRITE)
* Limitted LITTEL cluster to 1.5 ghz, this is perfectly fine and runs on a good voltage lvl which helpÂ´s the Battery a lot in decreased hicups during high clock ,which allow to stay most the time under -1000mv
* Played around the FM Radio and was abel to get it reconized in /dev as /radio0 expected but currently me lac of time to get it fully working.
